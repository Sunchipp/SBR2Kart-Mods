#Mods Folder
Wherever you have your SBR2Kart game files at, be sure you add a Mods folder in there for easier access!

## FOR NEWBS

Your mods folder will be in the Addons Menu here

Once you're in there find your mods folder and select the mod you would like to have!
Basic example:

My default player now is myself XD But this will be a way to find mods I have made for specific people
and for their content!
